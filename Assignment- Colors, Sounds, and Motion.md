# 3-2 Assignment: Colors, Sounds, and Motion

**Explain the impact that the use of color can have on user experience for an application.**

Colors should be used carefully throughout an application. The use of color can have a positive or negative effect on it and its users. These effects are usually emotional responses. Warm colors, such as red, yellow, and orange, may cause a user to have a feel pleasant and comfortable but can also them feel hostile and angry (Noble et al., 2018). Cool colors, such as blue, green, or purple, may have a user feel a range of emotions from calm to sad. Colors can influence a person’s perception, decisions, performance. Warm colors can have a user feel more satisfied, excited, or loyalty to a brand but can also cause them to feel threatened or like they’re going to fail at their task (Vetter, 2022). Cool colors can have a user feel enhanced creativity and relaxation. The use of colors, if carefully done, can entice a user to use an application and, if not, can turn them away. Colors can even help a user to concentrate. Using denotative colors will help user’s recognize different states in an application (Vaniukov, 2020). With colors, they’ll be able to see and understand their errors and successes.

**Discuss how research informs your own approach to designing with color.**

With this research, and the research I have done while completing a program of Media Communications, has taught me that the use and placement of colors will impact how and if my application will be used. I know that, depending on what kind of message I wish my app to assert, I need to choose colors that suit that message. I have also learned that using different variants of the chosen primary color will allow a user to distinguish different UI elements. Also, sparingly using a secondary color can be useful to highlight different elements throughout the UI, such as progress, selection, and switches. Since the nature of my application is to help caregivers look after their loved ones, it’ll require a harmonic blend of trust, calmness, and caution. A medium purple will be used as the applications primary color to elicit a sense of calmness users. In this, my hopes color will help the user say composed even in a case of an emergency. The brighter variant is used for focal points. Two secondary colors are used with sparsity. The first, a medium to dark blue, is used to enforce trust and evoke a remembrance of the medical field. One of the only places it’s used is on the lock widget to show things are satisfactorily. The second, a bright red, is used in this same location and acts as a caveat for urgent matters.

**Explain the impact that the use of sound can have on user experience for an application.**

In my previous studies, I’ve learned that sound can affect the mood of a user as well as color. A smooth sound would calm a user whereas a noisy sound would make them bothered. Sound can also help bring familiarity to your application; making users more likely to use your application repeatedly and suggest it to others. Another thing I learned, in my previous studies, is that the human voice can actually determine how a user feels about an application as well. A manly voice will have them thinking your application is professional but too strong and users will be turned off. While a soft one tends to have users feel calm, a familiar voice (or even dialect) will have them feeling like they belong and will put trust into your application. Sounds within a UI design should be simple and be used to announce to a user that they have done something. A simple ding may exclaim success and have the user feel accomplished. A downward sound could assert failure and that they need to try again. 

**Discuss how research informs your own approach to designing with sound.**

 Research has informed me that the use of sound should be done with prudence. Choosing the correct sound is just as important as when and where to use it. I will have to find the right sound for alerts in my application so that the user knows when to be concerned without overly stressing them out. Due to the nature of my application, it will need at least two sounds; a cautious and alarming one. 

**Explain the limitations of color and sound in UI/UX design.**

Color’s limitations are finding a comforting color scheme for my application. Too bright or vibrant colors may not send the message of comfort and reliability that my application is intended for. Too dark or dull colors will make the application have a gloomy, despairing feel and won’t entice users to use my application. The sound that will be selected for alerts must be carefully chosen as well. Too high pitched or fast paced of a sound may give the user auxiliary anxiety and may cause a user to stop using the app. Too soft of a sound could have the user not be concerned enough and have the same result.
