## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing programs requires tact in order for it to result in something useful. Applying pertinent naming conventions and comments are important for clear and optimal utilization. This also allows for the code to be reused and exploited elsewhere, which saves on time and resources. 
We see this with the general CRUD functions. That bout of code could be reused in any other python program that requires these functions for its own MongoDB database. If the database required more functionality, additional lines of code could be applied while still using the already written code as a baseline. 

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

An apt approach to problem solving is to take a step back and understand what part isn’t working. Where that be with syntax, logical, compile, or runtime errors, starting with the “red flag” often points you in the right direction. As that does not cover all problems that could arise while programming, it is important to different methods to find the problem. 
As in other projects, I approach problems by first looking at the problem and attempting to assess any issues present. I then begin fixing areas that I know how to fix. Next, I research what I do not know how to fix. If I am unsuccessful, I reach out for assistance. When attempting to meet a client's requests, it is important continuously check the specifications request documentation throughout your work so that they are met in a timely manner.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists play an instrumental part in the optimization of a company’s needs, user experience, and productivity. One way of we do this, is to write applicable code that creates effective applications. An application like ProjectTwo, grants such a company the swiftness of filtering through an entire database. By writing the code for the program, I allowed for a significantly shortened search and time.
