# CS319 UI/UX Development

## 3-3 Assignment: Paper Prototype

### **Purpose of Screens:**

**Screen1:**	
The purpose of screen1 is for the user to either sign-in or create an account. The screen features four input boxes; email and password for either section, along with two buttons; one for either section (only one is visible). There is also a “Forgot Password” link. The sign-in button will take the user to their account home screen; granted their credentials are valid. The “Forgot Password” link will bring the user to a page to enter their email for a verification code to be sent. The create account button will take the user to a screen to enter their credentials and loved one’s information. 

**Screen2:**	
This screen is the user’s home screen. On the top navbar there is a menu, app, and lock icon. The menu icon will open a drop-down menu with Account, Settings, and Resources buttons. The lock icon is a way the user can lockdown their loved one’s house. Under the navbar is a picture of the user’s loved one (LO) with their name and age. Under that is a list of the user’s LO vitals. The bottom navbar has a home icon (lighter purple/pink to show that that is the page that the user is currently on), a devices, track, and call icons that are purple. 

**Screen3:**	
The third screen is a list of devices that are connected to the application. It has the same top and bottom navbars with the device’s icon light purple/pink. Each device button has the name of the device, it’s status (ex: Off), and an arrow to indicate that there’s more. Tapping any of the device buttons will bring the user to a page with that device’s information and a slider button to change its status. 

### **Follow-up Interviews and Changes:**

**Interviews:**	
The interviews were conducted over the phone. I emailed the participants copies of the screens with instructions not to open them until the interview began. They lasted about 20 minutes each as I collected data; by taking notes of what they said. The first instruction I gave was to open the Screen1 file. From there, I asked what the pink around the input box meant, what they would need to do first in order to create an account, and what steps would they take in order to sign-in. For the home screen, I asked what page they believed they were on, what they thought the lock did, what color they thought the lock should be if it were locked, and how they would go about to get to the settings page. For the devices page, I asked what page they thought they were on, how they thought they would be able to change the status of a device, how they would get more information from a device, and does the red lock cause them concern. After each screen’s instructions, I asked if anything was missing, did they understand everything on the screen, and what they would change. The first interviewee had some troubles. They aren’t too technically experienced and some of the tasks were challenging for them (also because I’m not a very good drawer). Also, the design was made for an iPhone and the interviewee has an android. The issues this interviewee had were finding the settings page and getting into devices. The second interviewee had far less issues; being that of a tech savvy person. They offered some pointers on how to make the application easier for those who are not as technically inclined. 

### **Updates to Prototype:**

There are a few changes that I am going to make to my prototype. The first is a suggestion that was made by the second interviewee gave. Instead of having the hamburger menu icon, I’m going to put a plus(“+”) sign there. I’m going to have a I am going to put add a magnifying glass icon on the top navbar so that users can search the application for what they need. Lastly, I’m going to move the call up by the LO’s information and move the lock down onto the bottom navbar.
